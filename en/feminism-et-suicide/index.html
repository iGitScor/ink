            <p>Dear reader</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I wanted to write you this letter. I decided to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is your perception of death? What is your view of suicide? Do you distinguish between suicide and attempted suicide?
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not going to talk to you about death, but rather about suicide, feminism, empathy and kindness. But I' m going to talk to you about true caring, true empathy, true femi... Forget about that term. I'll come back to it later. And now I imagine you wondering what suicide has to do with feminism. Not too fast, it's time for a flashback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like anybody else who has never faced a problem or a difficult event, I didn't necessarily have an accurate view of what suicide is. And this is surely the case with feminism. Suicide is not a disease, nor a symptom, but a way to get a message across. It is often a last option. And this is where the difference between attempt and act comes in. The act is without hope for the person, whereas in the case of the attempt, the person no longer knows how to express his or her suffering. To say that suicide is selfish is therefore almost antinomic. On the other hand, it is true that the shockwave will have a significant impact, whether the attempt or the act is made.

            I will remember for a lifetime that phone call from X, telling me that X (himself/herself) had tried to kill himself/herself. I was in Paris. After the phone call, I started to have a panic, alone, in the hallway of the metro. I sat down on some steps and my nerves gave out. I cried a crazy amount of tears. I had no accommodation and was on my way to a friend’s friends house. I sent them a message "I can't come tonight". And I found myself in total emptiness. In the middle of Paris. I took the RER line B and went to Arcueil-Cachan. Why would you tell me? Because that was where I had a mission. I was working for company L. I contacted my Parisian manager (not my manager from Montpellier), to ask her for the number of my manager at company G. But she didn't have it. My objective was clear. To leave, and to warn that I would not come to work the next day. This failure led me to walk for hours in the streets of Cachan. It is 10pm. It is October. It's cold and I haven't eaten anything. I decide to take the Noctilien N14 to the terminus, Saint Ouen. After several round trips, I stay in Cachan walking. What you have to know is that it's 3 months before the attacks of the Hyper Cacher in Cachan. I feel that I am not in a condition to walk for hours, and I meet a person who asked about me. He has no papers but has managed to get accommodation for two days, through his employer. An empty flat. And here I am, squatting in a stranger's house, in a state of mental distress. Without any other solution. The next day, I was the first one there to start my work day. And you could tell physically that the day before had not been easy. And when I mentioned the N14 line, even though I didn't know Paris, they understood. They never knew why.

            I had a new job shortly afterwards. I can't say what day it was, or really if it was the next year, or the next. But I do remember going grocery shopping. And when I came back X had <s>tried</s> to hurt himself/herself again. But this time I had the vision in my head. And I still have it. At least once a week, that image is part of me. Seeing that person, in pain. Feeling helpless. I could describe this image over and over again. I would like to stop thinking about it or forget it. But it is there, engraved in my memory. And the memory I have of that day? I ended up in a bar with a friend, who listened to me in all kindness, without judging me or X. No idea of the time in between. I have a phobia of blood. And I have this image in my head. I don't blame X and never will but…
          </p> 
          <p>
            During these years, X was followed by a team of doctors, therapists and psychiatrists. I knew them well. I thank them for helping X, for saving him. But I can't help but be angry at them. There was never a moment when I was proposed to get help. To talk, to understand or to live with. It took me a long time to talk to a therapist about it. And I would like to talk about it again and again. I'd like to shout it out. To kick it out. Because this moment hurts me. But it's at home in my head. And no doctor would take it away from me at that time.
          </p>

            I spent many years in the highlands. I spent winters climbing in the snow, skiing. And as ironic as it may seem, I had my first feeling of vertigo when I arrived in Montpellier. So what is vertigo? It is a fear of insecurity of the void (spatial, not emotional). So it is possible to have vertigo sitting on a chair. Why am I telling you this? Because my vertigo is my safety net. I can't count the number of times I've stood on a bridge and wondered if it would hurt to jump. If I didn't do it, it was both fear and hope. Thank you to those who have been present, without being aware of it. Thank you. And I think I didn't do it, too, because I've been on the other side of the equation and I understand the situation a little better. But in order not to get to that point again, I feel the need to tell more people.

            Now we talk about feminism. From what I understand, feminism is above all a movement to eliminate the differences in treatment between men and women. The term feminism is for me badly chosen and understood. Because it attacks a society polarised by 2 genders, which is no longer the case. Besides, I have often read "why is it called feminism and not humanism?". Still in my opinion, if I'm wrong, don't hesitate to speak to me about it. What is racism? The fear of people of a different skin colour. Sexism is the fear of the opposite sex (or potentially one's own sex). So feminism is the fear of the female gender? No, but the term is not important.<br/>
            Now that the stage is set, why mention feminism in a text about suicide? Because the majority of suicides are committed by men. 84 men take their own lives every week ( to be confirmed, this is not the most important data), This represents between 66% and 75% of suicides. Men are less likely to ask for help. Coincidence? And why don't they ask for help? Because this world of patriarchy has set a negative image of the fragile men. Men must not cry. Men must be strong. A person who cries or has mental problems is not a man. This is actually what was put forward about homosexuality. It was considered a mental illness and so gays weren't considered as men. And just like feminism engages in a fight to remove differential treatment, so does this old concept of patriarchy. We should all be feminists. We should all be caring and compassionate. We should accept that the other is going through difficult times, without distinction. Reduce social pressure, social pressures. We should all be able to be angry, sad, tired, and so we could all learn to be happy.

            I wrote this article mainly to thank the people who reached out to me. Who didn't know what I was going through. Who accept me as I am, and who probably don't suspect that these sufferings make me who I am today. And I wrote this article to keep talking about mental health and suicide. To break the taboo. I am not a basketball player. Until two years ago (2020), the subject had never been brought up. Kevin Love broke that barrier by talking about his suicidal urges in 2012. 8 years of silence. 8 years. And other players followed. Thanks to those who illuminate my passion for the orange ball. LeBron, Kevin Love, Demar,... and more on a daily basis #TT you know.<br />
            I've frequently taken part in Movember, but it's not just a month to talk about men's health with prostate cancer exclusively, it's a month dedicated to health in general. This year (2021) I didn't participate because I was on the other side of the movement. So I'm fighting again and again. And when I will be ready again, I will take up this fight. Getting feminism accepted. Talking about mental health. Because the corporate world is not ready. Society is not ready. But that will change. Together we will overcome the patriarchy. And we will be able to cry. We will be able to cry of joy, and we will be able to be sad. And when we will have learned to accept sadness, we will learn to be happy.
