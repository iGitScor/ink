            <p>Dear reader</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I am writing this letter to you. I am writing this letter to myself. I am lost and I turn to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            For several years, I have been writing a conference on the theme of music and productivity. I'm taking a personal approach, as a return of experience, but also by trying to understand how it works, the scientific causes put forward, the beliefs, and the truths. I like this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I set out to write this lecture for many reasons. But one of them is not a good reason. I am amazed at the ability of some people to perform high-quality speaking exercises. I have watched and listened to hours of "social shows", presentations, be it TedX or much more techy conferences, although this is a big word, or rather a small word  considering the complexity of the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an introvert, proposing a conference is almost an ultimate way to prove to myself that I can have fun outside of my comfort zone. Almost ultimate, and if you think about it, it would even be a final step in this part of my  personality. The Grail of overcoming shyness. Don't let me catch you saying that I don't know how to speak in society. No. But I find that committing to sharing a bit of yourself orally is not for everyone. I'm not everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about this subject, sociology(?), directly or indirectly always attracted since my college years. A science without formula. An intriguing and bewitching complexity. The human. And then there are those long hours of isolation, listening to music, creating a bubble, a cocoon that nothing and nobody can burst. I will spare you years in this story. We are in 2014. So when I fall into the world of conferences, I take great pleasure in listening, studying. Yes but, at no time I feel legitimate to talk for 15, 20, 40 minutes on a topic related to my work. I won't take the step, unless… My life, my experiences, I'm the only one who has lived them, and this is the perfect subject and occasion. I have this crazy desire to launch myself. To concretize a project, to remember my college years as when we had to make presentations in class (#NotreDameDeParis).
          </p>
          <p>
            To be honest, this is not the first conference talk I've tried. First, there was the place of education in the professional world. But that sounded more like "I don't have a master's degree but I'm competent", I didn't feel like I was leading that fight. And I say fight because unfortunately in the tech world, there is a lot of animosities, rivalry, trolling, and other harmful postures. For example, I met an intern, who was in a master's program, who declared, loudly, that he was better than me because I only had a bachelor's degree (I was already employed at this time). I let it go. But words are never in the air. They sometimes turn into evils.
          </p> 
          <p>
            So I turned down the fight for education's place in the professional world. Yet I was happy with my slides and notes, asking to be careful with the comparisons. That we spend years competing and never really learn how to collaborate in our studies. So it's natural that comparison is commonplace in the professional world. And then I got into writing for music. I deleted some texts, and I started over and over again. I tried several methods. And still, I didn't get anything out. I never did. And here I am, writing this article, remember the basic rule of my very first lecture topic. Avoid comparisons. It is not just because people can and do a lecture, does not mean that not succeeding is a failure. Not totally a failure. It is a failure. It's a failure of a system where everything has to go faster. Where you have to prove more things. Where your resume has to be the most perfect one, both the most succinct and with the most content, podcasts, personal projects, you name it. The era of more and more defines my quit as a failure. And so I define this abandonment as a failure. This one is constantly fed by recruiters who are looking for ultra-passionate people. Not having a computer becomes a handicap. Not attending meetups regularly becomes a handicap. Not having open-source projects becomes a handicap (for the people who recruit, open-source development ≠).
          </p>
          <p>
            And then, there is the importance of inclusiveness, caring, and empathy in my life… and even more so in the world of work. What's wearing with these values is that it's not an easy choice. And here we go again with words that become evils.
          </p>

              Anyway. Now I wonder where the pause button is. Because once launched in the active world, the slightest deviation is a failure, the slightest deviation is a weight that will add to the others and will make the rest of the active world, your active world, more complicated and complex. I wonder where the real pause button is. The one that doesn't kill a career. The one that allows you to change cities and find a place to live. The one that will stop the race for rental files to earn 4 times the amount of the rent, while having a guarantor. The one where people will take the time to understand the story, the context and not the instantaneous. Because no, not having a guarantor should not be a handicap. Not working for 2 months should not be a reason for not hiring. The one that will allow people, high graduates, to find a job, because having a master's degree or a degree in engineering school does not guarantee a job.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm looking for that pause button because my body needs it, but mostly because my head needs it.
              I've attended to focus groups with people whose disability is more than just limited mobility. And it's time we all push that button together. So that people who are excluded from exclusion are not invisible to us. So that the victims of ever more are not judged for what they cannot do. I have, for example, forgotten to respond to recruiters because I couldn't. I have canceled parties with friends, lost sight of them because I couldn't. But now I've reached the point where I can't. Where the exhaustion is stronger and faster than anything else. And yet I can't catch a break. Because I won't and can't lose my job. I can't lose my career progression. I can't afford to lose half my salary to heal myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been 1 year now that the fatigue is more and more present. An emotional void is growing inside me. I am losing the people around me. I am losing the people who love me and those I love. I see it, and I can't do anything, I feel powerless. And nothing helps me. An employer decided to break my trial period the day after a discussion during which I revealed myself. During this discussion, I told him I had health problems. And that I was not the only one in my private circle. Nothing helped me. My general practitioner simply made me take a blood test. I thought I was clear in explaining this emptiness in me. This inability to find pleasure. I used to take a lot of pleasure in doing research, watching conferences, and projecting myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              This world of frenzy is losing me and I am afraid of the unknown world I am diving into. And now I create my own frenzy within this world. Unable. Lost. The worst part of it all? I am not the only one. Even less so since this pandemic. But the irony is that I'm not alone, I'm alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wouldn't say that all this is the fault of the pandemic. It just put an end to a dream of living abroad, or rather to shorten it because this parenthesis had a deadline anyway. I wouldn't say it's so-and-so's fault. Everyone is acting in their own interest. Companies are in hyper-competition. The job market is cutthroat. The tech world is cutthroat. The world is cutthroat. And I try to convince myself that this is not my fault. It's not my fault, is it?
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not looking for someone to blame, because all this is complex. The prism through which we perceive what happens to us will always be different for each individual. If I ran away from the fights, it's because I already had some in my private life, some more important, and some more difficult. I won't go into details as this doesn't only include me as an actor of these moments. But with a different context, all this could have been different. However, isn't that the definition of life? Successive causes and consequences, adventures, actions and inactions. I'm convinced that my private life wasn't all plain sailing, you can't imagine, fortunately, what was my journey these past years and I'm still struggling with this. I can't get rid of the idea that it's my fault.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wait… Maybe it's the fault of this working world after all, that I'm not doing well. I won't mention the term burn-out, because I wouldn't know how to diagnose it, but I've had a rocky road. I had a boss who gave me an ultimatum, the culmination of a toxic environment par excellence. I saved my job by enlisting the help of the rest of the company. And I left that environment. Later, I was bullied by someone who was not yet hired. And I had to leave that environment. Later, I already mentioned the end of probation period just after I dared to talk about mental health. And I had to leave that environment. It was (and is) hard to be motivated to work, to enjoy myself, to have a ball in my stomach, to have anxiety on a daily basis. And then there is Paris. This city that I love and that I hate the most on earth. And if France was my toxic environment so much my parenthesis abroad made me happy and appeased me personally and professionally, or is it the current situation that makes me doubt… Who damaged the other, my private life or my professional life? I finish this letter with more questions than answers, but it was necessary that I put my difficulties and wounds in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks for reading and don't forget to hit that pause button. It's never too late, I hope. Take care of yourself, take care of you, and don't cut ties with those around you unless necessary. Finally, do what you think is right, I am not here to give orders or advice. In conclusion, if all of this sounds familiar with your life… You are not (the only) alone.
